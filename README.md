- Title: **Forecasting Airplane Crashes: A Time Series Analysis**
- Author: **OULAD ALI Marouane Abdeldjalil**

## Abstract
In this project, we conduct a time series analysis of airplane crashes data to forecast future occurrences. The dataset comprises historical data on the number of airplane crashes per year, spanning multiple years (From 1915 to 2009). Our goal is to develop a forecasting model that can accurately predict the number of airplane crashes in upcoming years. Through this analysis, we aim to contribute insights into aviation safety and risk management.

## Introduction
The aviation industry plays a crucial role in global transportation, with millions of flights occurring annually. However, airplane crashes remain a significant concern due to their potential impact on human lives and safety. Understanding the patterns and trends in airplane crashes can provide valuable insights for improving aviation safety measures.

In this project, we focus on analyzing historical data related to airplane crashes. The dataset includes information about the number of airplane crashes per year over a specific time period. By applying time series analysis techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data. Additionally, we seek to develop a forecasting model that can predict the future occurrences of airplane crashes based on historical trends.

Through this analysis, we strive to enhance our understanding of the factors influencing airplane crashes and contribute to the development of predictive models for aviation safety management.
