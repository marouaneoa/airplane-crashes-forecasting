- Author: **OULAD ALI Marouane Abdeldjalil**

## Abstract
In this project, we conduct a time series analysis of airplane crashes data to forecast future occurrences. The dataset comprises historical data on the number of airplane crashes per year, spanning multiple years (From 1915 to 2009). Our goal is to develop a forecasting model that can accurately predict the number of airplane crashes in upcoming years. Through this analysis, we aim to contribute insights into aviation safety and risk management.

## Introduction
The aviation industry plays a crucial role in global transportation, with millions of flights occurring annually. However, airplane crashes remain a significant concern due to their potential impact on human lives and safety. Understanding the patterns and trends in airplane crashes can provide valuable insights for improving aviation safety measures.

In this project, we focus on analyzing historical data related to airplane crashes. The dataset includes information about the number of airplane crashes per year over a specific time period. By applying time series analysis techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data. Additionally, we seek to develop a forecasting model that can predict the future occurrences of airplane crashes based on historical trends.

Through this analysis, we strive to enhance our understanding of the factors influencing airplane crashes and contribute to the development of predictive models for aviation safety management.

## Discussion

**Insights on the data**

The increase in airplane crashes after 1920 can be attributed to the rapid expansion of airplane construction during that period. However, after 1990, the number of crashes began to decline noticeably. This decline can be linked to the implementation of various safety measures by airplane manufacturers, highlighting the industry's commitment to improving safety standards over time.

**Our Goal**

We wanted to build a model to predict how many airplane crashes might happen each year. We looked at data from many years of crashes.

**What We Did**

1. **Analyzed the Data:** We investigated patterns in the data, like if crashes were increasing or decreasing over time, and if there were any seasonal trends.
2. **Picked the Best Model:** We tried out different models to see which one could predict crashes the most accurately. We used tests and comparisons to pick the best model.
3. **Tested the Model:** We split the data into two parts. We trained the model on one part and then tested it on the other part to see how well it could predict crashes it hadn't seen before.

**Challenges and Results**

It wasn't always easy, especially because the data wasn't stationary. But in the end, we found a model that could predict crashes pretty well. This can help the aviation industry improve safety by understanding crash patterns and taking steps to prevent them.

**Why This Matters**

Using data and models to predict crashes can help keep airplanes safe. This project shows that analyzing data and building models can be a powerful tool for improving aviation safety.
